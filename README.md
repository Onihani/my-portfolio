# Portfolio Repo

Hey there! This repo’s got all the versions of my portfolio as I’ve worked on and improved it over time.

## What’s Inside

- **v1/**, **v2/**, **v3/**, etc.: Each folder is a snapshot of my portfolio at a certain stage. Newer ones are shinier and better, of course.

## Latest Version

- Check out the current portfolio here: [nathanielquansah.com](https://nathanielquansah.com)
- Want to see older ones? They’re on subdomains like:
  - [v1.nathanielquansah.com](https://v1.nathanielquansah.com)
  - [v2.nathanielquansah.com](https://v2.nathanielquansah.com)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Onihani/my-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Jump into the version you’re interested in:
   ```bash
   cd v1   # or v2, v3, etc.
   ```

3. Check the README in that folder for setup instructions (if there’s one).

## A Few Notes
- Every version shows how my skills and ideas have grown over time.
- Feel free to poke around and hit me up with feedback or ideas for future versions or updates!
